#### FAQ

1. Is it okay to put 'int i = 0' inside my for loops?

    Short answer: yes. But your prof may disagree.

    Long answer: initializer inside the for loops got introduced in C90, previous versions did not allow
    `for(int i = 0; i < size; ++i)` which meant programmers needed to do the following:

    ```C
    int i;
    for(i = 0; i < size; ++i)
    ```

    For this reason you may hear some people questioning initializers inside for loops. It's been 28 years 
    since 1990 however and there's no reason to use the old way but old habits die hard.

2. What's the difference of `i++` vs `++i`?

    Consider the following:

    ```C
    int i = 0;
    int j = 0;
    printf("i = %d, j = %d\n", i, j);
    printf("i++ = %d, ++j = %d\n", i++, ++j);
    ```

    The output of the program is:

    ```C
    i = 0, j = 0 
    i++ = 0, ++j = 1 // i++ returns i before the increment, ++j returns j after the increment
    ```

3. Why will my code compile in visual studio but not in matrix?

    There might be several reasons, the most common one is that you are using features which may not
    be supported in C89 (matrix's compiler defaults to C89). In this case the fix is easy: add `-std=c99`
    to the compiler command line(eg: `g++ -std=c90 file.c -o output`)

4. Why will my code compile in matrix but not Visual Studio?

    Same as above, there might be several reasons. The most common one is that by default
    Visual Studio marks the `scanf()` function as insecure(Windows provides `scanf_s` which is secure but non-standard).

    How to fix: add `#define _SECURE_CRT_NO_WARNINGS` at the top of your C files.
